Quiz 1
================

Details on Quiz 1 will appear here.

## Some Early Notes

- Quiz 1 will be made available to you at 5 PM Eastern time on Friday 2020-10-02. It is due at Noon on 2020-10-07.
    - You will definitely need to be able to do some coding in R to complete the Quiz. There are also questions that involve interpreting R output, and some questions where R is not relevant at all.
    - The Quiz is meant to take 4 hours, and I have given you 115 hours to do it. Some people will choose to take much, much longer.

### The Five Key Sources of Material

There are five sources of material I am using to decide what goes into Quiz 1 and what does not. I won't use anything other than those five sources to motivate the questions. Anything in these materials is fair game...

1. Course Notes: Chapters 1-16
2. Slides and Discussions / Lectures from Classes 01-12 (of course you already have heard Classes 01-10 and the Class 11 slides are available now, too.)
3. Project A Proposal instructions and the work you will have done completing the data management there.
4. Jeffrey Leek, The Elements of Data Analytic Style (the entire text)
5. David Spiegelhalter The Art of Statistics: How to Learn from Data (introduction and chapters 1-3)
    - I also expect you to have read Chapters 4, 7, 8 and 9 of Spiegelhalter, but I've decided not to ask about them on Quiz 1.

Note also that I may not use all of these materials in the Quiz. I don't want it to be too long. 

### Getting Help During the Quiz

If you need clarification on a Quiz question, you have exactly two ways of getting help:

- You can ask your question in a **private post on Piazza to the instructors**. (This is the only kind of post you will be able to make on Piazza during the Quiz.)
- You can ask your question via email to **431-help at case dot edu**. 

During the Quiz period (5 PM 2020-10-02 through noon 2020-10-07) we will not answer questions about the Quiz in any way except the two approaches listed above. 
That means we won't answer Quiz questions in that time frame...

- in TA office hours,
- in class or before/after class on Tuesday 2020-10-06,
- via email except through **431-help at case dot edu**
