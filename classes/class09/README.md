## Today's Slides

- Class 09 slides are available in [PDF format](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/classes/class09/431_class-09-slides_2020.pdf), as well as in [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/classes/class09/431_class-09-slides_2020.Rmd).

## Meeting Our Colleagues

1. I've created a true Shared Drive on Google called **431 Fall 2020 Dr Love and Students** that you should now all have access to (but only when logged into Google via CWRU). Let us know if you have any trouble accessing that material.
    - Among other things, you should find a folder there of **Introductory Student Videos**. Those with stars there are the folks we've already met. Today, we'll break with alphabetical order and meet students listed there as numbers 70-72 and 13-15, specifically **Peng Zhang, Chenya Zhao, Lin Zhu, Jane Hinkle, Leila Hojat and Natasha Ingles**.

## Announcements

1. There will be a Minute Paper after Class 09. Please complete it by Noon Wednesday 2020-09-23.
2. We welcome a new Teaching Assistant, Claudia Cabrera, who has extensive experience as a TA for 431-432. Claudia is now in her second year of a PhD at CWRU. Read more about Claudia in the Syllabus, and look for her in our new Monday 3-4:30 PM TA Office Hours, and on Piazza.
3. For those of you looking for a paper you can cite if you need a reference about "not testing for Normality" being an OK idea, I recommend [The importance of the Normality assumption in public health data sets](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11910059/) by Thomas Lumley, Paula Diehr, Scott Emerson and Lu Chen.
    - I also recommend [this blog post](https://notstatschat.rbind.io/2019/02/09/what-have-i-got-against-the-shapiro-wilk-test/) specifically about the problems inherent in one particular type of test (the Shapiro-Wilk test.) 
4. You can still [sign up for the mailing list for The Philosophy of Data Science Series](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1YDZUkLmzIiujcaEVl3JkjIffKSwK_orFMjEkkyLvFUQ/), which now has [a welcome video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeHEfHN39Cc). The next session is about "Critical Reasoning in Medical Machine Learning".
5. Better Health Partnership, where I was founding Data Director, and now serve as Chief Data Scientist, has the fifth of its convening webinars from this summer on 2020-09-23 at Noon, and it's entitled [Addressing Bias within Health Care Systems](http://betterhealthpartnership.org/convening_2020_date5.asp). If you're interested, please register or learn more at that link. Registration will also allow you to watch the video later if you prefer.
6. I've made some edits to the Course Notes (especially in Section 5.4.3 regarding kurtosis) and added several new chapters, beginning with Chapter 11. I expect the complete set of 431 notes to eventually include about 30 chapters.
7. I've added two very important pieces to the [Project A examples](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-projectA/examples.html) page.
    - This includes a 30-minute video about getting the data ready and using RStudio most effectively, and 
    - A very very important sample proposal, using 2019 data, and including the R Markdown to produce [this HTML result](https://rpubs.com/TELOVE/projA-proposal-example-431-2020).

## What Should I Be Working On?

1. Please complete the [Minute Paper after Class 09](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/tree/master/minutepapers) by Wednesday 2020-09-23 at Noon. Thank you.
2. [Lab 04](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/labs/lab04/lab04.md) requires some searching through the literature in Questions 1-5. You will also need to read and use [this article by Jeff Leek](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-formula-for-decoding-health-news/) to do Questions 1-5. Questions 6-8 are about the [Palmer Penguins](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins), from [Chapter 2 of the Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-notes/looking-at-the-palmer-penguins.html).
3. [Project A](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-projectA/), in particular the Proposal, which is due 2020-10-02. Watch the video (if you like) and use the Example R Markdown file I've provided as a template. Those two tools should be just about all you need to get your proposal moving well.

## One Last Thing

Let's take the first of our looks today at the [2020 Election Forecast at FiveThirtyEight.com](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/).
