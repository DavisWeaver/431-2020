## Today's Slides

- Class 05 slides will be available in [PDF format](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/classes/class05/431_class-05-slides_2020.pdf), as well as in [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/classes/class05/431_class-05-slides_2020.Rmd).

## Announcements

1. So far this semester, Dr. Love (and the TAs) have been chasing you down via email if something isn't submitted on time, or isn't submitted correctly, and reminding you about deadlines outside of class time. Enjoy it while it lasts, because we intend to (essentially) stop doing that after [Lab 02](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/labs/lab02/lab02.md).
2. Detailed instructions for downloading individual .csv or .Rmd files using various browser and operating system combinations are now found [here on our Data and Code page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data/blob/master/README.md#detailed-steps-for-downloading-individual-csv-or-rmd-files-from-github).
3. Chapters 7-10 in the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-notes/) are now available. All 10 Chapters so far touch on issues of visualization and data management that we are discussing in class through this week.
4. I adjusted the late penalty for Labs in the Syllabus.
    - For each Lab, on-time submission gets you detailed TA comments plus up to 100% of available points.
    - I'll post an Answer Sketch by noon on the day after each Lab is due. Submission before I do that gets you some TA comments plus up to 90% of available points.
    - Submissions after that (but within a week of the deadline) will get minimal (if any) TA comments plus up to 75% of available points on the Lab.
    - Remember that your lowest two Lab grades will be dropped before we calculate your Lab average.
    - People having trouble with technology issues / remote learning / etc. can contact Professor Love via email to discuss, but the Labs will go on without you, according to these rules. You should submit your work as soon as you can.
5. I corrected some typographical errors in [Lab 02](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/labs/lab02/lab02.md). I would be surprised if this changes any of your responses if you've already worked on the Lab. Lab 02 submission will open today (2020-09-08) on Canvas.
6. [Lab 03](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/labs/lab03/lab03.md) and [Lab 04](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/labs/lab04/lab04.md) are now available, for those of you eager to get ahead of things.
7. I encourage you to adjust your email settings for the class on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/case/fall2020/pqhs431) if the messages become overwhelming. If you click on the gear at the top right of any Piazza screen, then select Account Settings and scroll down to Class & Email Settings, you can edit your email notifications. 
    - The Daily Digest seems like a good option for new Questions or Notes from my perspective, although I recommend Real Time for updates to Questions or Notes you follow. 
    - Any announcements I designate as necessary reading for the whole class on Piazza will be sent to you via email immediately regardless of your settings.
8. The [modelsummary](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/modelsummary/index.html) package has finally reached a sufficiently steady state that I'm recommending it as a package to install in the class. I've modified [our R Packages list](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/r_packages.html) appropriately. 
    - The package provides some great tools for creating summary tables (including things like Table 1) for models and tibbles. More to come, but you can see lots of examples at the [github repository for the package](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/modelsummary/index.html) plus I've added a couple of examples to Chapter 10 of the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-notes/).

## What Should I Be Working On?

As always, check the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html) for links to and deadlines for all deliverables (labs, minute papers, quizzes and projects.)

1. There is a Minute Paper after Class 05, due Wednesday (tomorrow) at noon. The link will appear on [the Minute Paper page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/minutepapers/README.md). Please remember to do this, as it's an important part of your class participation grade, and it provides very important feedback to Dr. Love and the TAs as we make course adjustments.
2. [Lab 02](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/labs/lab02/lab02.md) is the next deliverable after the Minute Paper, and requires some coding (and knitting) in R Markdown. You will also need to have read Spiegelhalter Chapters 1-3 to complete it.

## One Last Thing
