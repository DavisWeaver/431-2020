## Today's Slides

- Class 10 slides are available in [PDF format](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/classes/class10/431_class-10-slides_2020.pdf), as well as in [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/classes/class10/431_class-10-slides_2020.Rmd).

## Announcements

1. Dr. Love will provide feedback on your comments from the Minute Paper after Class 09.
2. On 2020-09-22, I posted a short (~9 minutes) video to Piazza and the Shared Google Drive (in the Dr Love Special Videos folder) where I created and then debugged some common errors in using RStudio and R Markdown using the iris data, which is sort of like the palmerpenguins data for Lab 04. Take a look, if you are interested.
3. I fixed an error in the grading for class participation from [the Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-syllabus/). 
    - I had mistakenly implied that you would receive 5 points for each Minute Paper instead of 4. 

## What Should I Be Working On?

1. [Lab 04](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/labs/lab04/lab04.md) requires some searching through the literature in Questions 1-5. You will also need to read and use [this article by Jeff Leek](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-formula-for-decoding-health-news/) to do Questions 1-5. Questions 6-8 are about the [Palmer Penguins](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins), from [Chapter 2 of the Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-notes/looking-at-the-palmer-penguins.html).
2. [Project A](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-projectA/), in particular the Proposal, which is due 2020-10-02. Watch the video (if you like) and use the Example R Markdown file I've provided as a template. Those two tools should be just about all you need to get your proposal moving well.
3. Reading: As mentioned in Class 09, the most urgent thing is reading [Jeff Leek's article: Finally, a Formula for Decoding Health News](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-formula-for-decoding-health-news/) from FiveThirtyEight which is a big part of [Lab 04](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/labs/lab04/lab04.md). By 2020-10-02, you'll need to have finished the Leek text and chapters 8-9 of Spiegelhalter.

## One Last Thing

To come.
