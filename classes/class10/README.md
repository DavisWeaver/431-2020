## Today's Slides

- Class 10 slides are available in [PDF format](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/classes/class10/431_class-10-slides_2020.pdf), as well as in [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/classes/class10/431_class-10-slides_2020.Rmd).

## Today's Breakout Session

In today's breakout session, we're [going back to the movies](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/classes/movies/breakout2.md)!

## Announcements

1. Dr. Love has posted [feedback on the Minute Paper after Class 09](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/tree/master/minutepapers).
    - Several students expressed interest in finding a partner to work on Project A. I've emailed a Google Form to students on that list to help them provide a few comments that might help someone understand why they're taking the class, and what they're looking for in a partner, and I've provided the results I have so far to the students on that list. Good luck finding a partner!
2. We've made some effort to clarify what TAs will and won't do during office hours going forward.
    - We encourage you to visit TA office hours when you need one-on-one support. There, you can share your screen of the work that you're doing, and the TAs will be happy to provide you with oral feedback on specific questions that you have about R coding or statistical issues. 
    - If you need help with grammar and usage of English, you should look into CWRU'sÂ resources for supporting students, [as I've described them in the Syllabus, particularly sections 15.6 through 15.8](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-syllabus/university-resources-for-student-support.html#educational-services-for-students). 
    - If the TA has time during office hours (i.e. there is no one else waiting) they *may* (at their discretion) also be willing to read over sections of your work with you and make a few suggestions about grammar and syntax. Note that not all TAs will feel comfortable about doing this, and you should be respectful of that, should they decline.
    - Whether during or outside of office hours, TAs are **not** available to proofread or edit your work for you. That is your job. 
3. On 2020-09-22, I posted a short (~9 minutes) video to Piazza and the Shared Google Drive (in the Dr Love Special Videos folder) where I created and then debugged some common errors in using RStudio and R Markdown using the iris data, which is sort of like the palmerpenguins data for Lab 04. Take a look, if you are interested.
4. I fixed an error in the grading for class participation from [the Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-syllabus/). 
    - I had mistakenly implied that you would receive 5 points for each Minute Paper instead of 4. 
5. The [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-notes/) are available through Chapter 22. The remaining chapters (I'm still thinking this semester will have about 30 chapters) will discuss regression modeling and will appear in late October, I expect.
6. You may be interested in this YouTube video on [Critical Reasoning in Medical Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5YmdoCiyug), which is part of the Philosophy of Data Science series.
7. If you want to watch someone masterfully analyze data in R using the Tidyverse, I cannnot recommend [David Robinson's Tidy Tuesday videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeiiqmVK07qhY-wvg3IZiZQ) enough. 
    - Last week's screencast was on [Analyzing government spending on kids in R](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRPrVsnNwo), but there are many available.

## What Should I Be Working On?

1. [Lab 04](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/labs/lab04/lab04.md) requires some searching through the literature in Questions 1-5. You will also need to read and use [this article by Jeff Leek](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-formula-for-decoding-health-news/) to do Questions 1-5. Questions 6-8 are about the [Palmer Penguins](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins), from [Chapter 2 of the Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-notes/looking-at-the-palmer-penguins.html).
2. [Project A](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-projectA/), in particular the Proposal, which is due 2020-10-02. Watch the video (if you like) and use the Example R Markdown file I've provided as a template. Those two tools should be just about all you need to get your proposal moving well.
3. Reading: As mentioned in Class 09, the most urgent thing is reading [Jeff Leek's article: Finally, a Formula for Decoding Health News](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-formula-for-decoding-health-news/) from FiveThirtyEight which is a big part of [Lab 04](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/labs/lab04/lab04.md). By 2020-10-02, you'll need to have finished the Leek text and chapters 8-9 of Spiegelhalter.

## Who Will We Meet Today?

- Michael Zhang, Luke Zhang, Emily Zetzer, Aya Jishi, Naomi Joseph and Ali Klein (67-69 and 16-18 from the Introductory Student Videos in our Shared Google Drive)

## One Last Thing

[What's so hard about histograms?](https://tinlizzie.org/histograms/) is an amazing interactive essay by Aran Lunzer and Amelia McNamara.
