## Today's Slides

- Class 10 slides are available in [PDF format](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/classes/class10/431_class-10-slides_2020.pdf), as well as in [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/classes/class10/431_class-10-slides_2020.Rmd).

## Who Will We Meet Today?

- Michael Zhang, Luke Zhang, Emily Zetzer, Aya Jishi, Naomi Joseph and Ali Klein (67-69 and 16-18 from the Introductory Student Videos in our Shared Google Drive)

## Announcements

1. Dr. Love has posted [feedback on the Minute Paper after Class 09](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/tree/master/minutepapers).
    - Several students expressed interest in finding a partner to work on Project A. I've emailed a Google Form to students on that list to help them provide a few comments that might help someone understand why they're taking the class, and what they're looking for in a partner, and I've provided the results I have so far to the students on that list. Good luck finding a partner!
2. On 2020-09-22, I posted a short (~9 minutes) video to Piazza and the Shared Google Drive (in the Dr Love Special Videos folder) where I created and then debugged some common errors in using RStudio and R Markdown using the iris data, which is sort of like the palmerpenguins data for Lab 04. Take a look, if you are interested.
3. I fixed an error in the grading for class participation from [the Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-syllabus/). 
    - I had mistakenly implied that you would receive 5 points for each Minute Paper instead of 4. 
4. The [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-notes/) are available through Chapter 22. The remaining chapters (I'm still thinking this semester will have about 30 chapters) will discuss regression modeling and will appear in late October, I expect.
5. You may be interested in this YouTube video on [Critical Reasoning in Medical Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5YmdoCiyug), which is part of the Philosophy of Data Science series.
6. If you want to watch someone masterfully analyze data in R using the Tidyverse, I cannnot recommend [David Robinson's Tidy Tuesday videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeiiqmVK07qhY-wvg3IZiZQ) enough. 
    - Last week's screencast was on [Analyzing government spending on kids in R](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRPrVsnNwo), but there are many available.

## What Should I Be Working On?

1. [Lab 04](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/labs/lab04/lab04.md) requires some searching through the literature in Questions 1-5. You will also need to read and use [this article by Jeff Leek](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-formula-for-decoding-health-news/) to do Questions 1-5. Questions 6-8 are about the [Palmer Penguins](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins), from [Chapter 2 of the Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-notes/looking-at-the-palmer-penguins.html).
2. [Project A](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-projectA/), in particular the Proposal, which is due 2020-10-02. Watch the video (if you like) and use the Example R Markdown file I've provided as a template. Those two tools should be just about all you need to get your proposal moving well.
3. Reading: As mentioned in Class 09, the most urgent thing is reading [Jeff Leek's article: Finally, a Formula for Decoding Health News](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-formula-for-decoding-health-news/) from FiveThirtyEight which is a big part of [Lab 04](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/labs/lab04/lab04.md). By 2020-10-02, you'll need to have finished the Leek text and chapters 8-9 of Spiegelhalter.

## One Last Thing

[What's so hard about histograms?](https://tinlizzie.org/histograms/) is an amazing interactive essay by Aran Lunzer and Amelia McNamara. We'll spend a few minutes taking a look.
