## Today's Slides

- Class 08 slides are available in [PDF format](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/classes/class08/431_class-08-slides_2020.pdf), as well as in [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/classes/class08/431_class-08-slides_2020.Rmd).

## Announcements

1. I'm so sorry about going over time on Tuesday. The TAs will speak up in the future when 2:10 arrives, so that won't happen again. If you see that it's 2:11, and no one's said anything, please be brave and let me know. I will always want to have 2-3 minutes at the end to conclude the class properly.
2. [Feedback on the Minute Paper after Class 07](http://bit.ly/431-2020-minute-07-feedback) is now available.
3. I added a line to [Lab 03](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/labs/lab03/lab03.md) and to [Lab 04](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/labs/lab04/lab04.md) about wanting complete sentences in responses to all questions on those Labs. Just presenting your code, without any discussion, isn't sufficient for full credit on Labs. I also shortened [Lab 04](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/labs/lab04/lab04.md) a bit, by eliminating a question.
4. RStudio is sponsoring a [Table Contest](https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/09/15/announcing-the-2020-rstudio-table-contest/)!
5. The [introductory videos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1j35B6f_9fHyK8PT2LwRy172qD5Cx0U_j?usp=sharing) you all made (as part of Lab 01) are gradually becoming available for viewing, so that you can listen again if you miss something. Today, we're meeting Oindila De, Razaq Durodoye, Ali Elsharkawi, Akif Gormez, Caitlyn Grubbs, Anniya Gu and Clara Harb.
6. [Project A instructions](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-projectA/) were modified this morning to shorten the task list and provide some additional context. Please review them over the weekend.
    - I would probably wait to get started on anything (other than potentially finding a partner to work with) too seriously until you see my Example materials early next week. The "proposal" deadline is 2020-10-02 and the project is due 2020-10-20.
    - I will post the Example materials as soon as I finish writing them.
7. I haven't forgotten about the movies, but we won't get back to them today.
8. I'm also going to switch us over to a Shared Google Drive for a couple of things after class today, so that we'll retain foldering. Look for an email from me.

## What Should I Be Working On?

1. [Lab 03](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/labs/lab03/lab03.md) is the next deliverable. You should be able to complete it by the end of today's class. This could easily be the second longest lab of the semester (we expect Lab 08 to be the longest.)
2. [Lab 04](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/labs/lab04/lab04.md) requires some searching through the literature in Questions 1-5. You will also need to read and use [this article by Jeff Leek](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-formula-for-decoding-health-news/) to do Questions 1-5. Questions 6-8 are about the [Palmer Penguins](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins), from [Chapter 2 of the Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-notes/looking-at-the-palmer-penguins.html).
3. This weekend, you should [read the (revised) Project A Instructions](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-projectA/). 
4. Readings: Spiegelhalter through Chapter 4, and Chapter 7, and Leek through section 5, and sections 9-12.

## One Last Thing

We'll start talking about the US Election next week, I think. FiveThirtyEight has an interesting project on "[How to Vote in the 2020 Election](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/how-to-vote-2020/)" which might be worth your time.
