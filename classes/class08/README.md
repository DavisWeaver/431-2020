## Announcements

1. I'm so sorry about going over time on Tuesday. The TAs will speak up in the future when 2:10 arrives, so that won't happen again. If you see that it's 2:11, and no one's said anything, please be brave and let me know. I will always want to have 2-3 minutes at the end to conclude the class properly.
2. Feedback on the Minute Paper after Class 07 is coming soon.
3. I added a line to Lab 03 and to Lab 04 about wanting complete sentences in responses to all questions on those Labs. Just presenting your code, without any discussion, isn't sufficient for full credit on Labs.
4. RStudio is sponsoring a [Table Contest](https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/09/15/announcing-the-2020-rstudio-table-contest/)!



## What Should I Be Working On?

1. Lab 03, due Monday.




## One Last Thing
