## Today's Slides

- Class 08 slides are available in [PDF format](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/classes/class08/431_class-08-slides_2020.pdf), as well as in [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/classes/class08/431_class-08-slides_2020.Rmd).

## Announcements

1. I'm so sorry about going over time on Tuesday. The TAs will speak up in the future when 2:10 arrives, so that won't happen again. If you see that it's 2:11, and no one's said anything, please be brave and let me know. I will always want to have 2-3 minutes at the end to conclude the class properly.
2. Feedback on the Minute Paper after Class 07 is coming soon.
3. I added a line to Lab 03 and to Lab 04 about wanting complete sentences in responses to all questions on those Labs. Just presenting your code, without any discussion, isn't sufficient for full credit on Labs.
4. RStudio is sponsoring a [Table Contest](https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/09/15/announcing-the-2020-rstudio-table-contest/)!
5. The introductory videos you all made (as part of Lab 01) are gradually becoming available for viewing on our Shared Google Drive in the Introductory Student Videos folder, so that you can listen again if you miss something. Today, we're meeting Oindila De, Razaq Durodoye, Ali Elsharkawi, Akif Gormez, Caitlyn Grubbs, Anniya Gu and Clara Harb.

## What Should I Be Working On?

1. [Lab 03](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/labs/lab03/lab03.md) is the next deliverable. You should be able to complete it by the end of today's class.
2. [Lab 04](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/labs/lab04/lab04.md) requires some searching through the literature in Questions 1-5, so I would get started on that, especially because there isn't a lot in that Lab that you can't do now.
3. This weekend, you should [read the Project A Instructions at their spiffy new website](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-projectA/). 
    - I would probably wait to get started on anything (other than potentially finding a partner to work with) too seriously until you see my Example materials early next week. The "proposal" deadline is 2020-10-02 and the project is due 2020-10-20.
4. Readings: Spiegelhalter through Chapter 4, and Chapter 7, and Leek through section 5, and sections 9-12.

## One Last Thing

To come.
