## Announcements

1. **STILL TO COME** 
    - Minute Paper after Class 11
    - Answer Sketch for Lab 04
    - Grades + TA Comments on Lab 03
2. Quiz information
    - Quiz 1 will be made available to you at 5 PM Eastern time on Friday 2020-10-02. It is due at Noon on 2020-10-07.
    - Piazza will be inactive during the Quiz, in the sense that you will only be permitted to make private posts to the instructors during that time.
    - There are five sources of material I am using to decide what goes into Quiz 1 and what does not. Anything in these materials is fair game...
        1. Course Notes: Chapters 1-16
        2. Slides and Discussions / Lectures from Classes 01-12 (of course you already have heard Classes 01-10 and the Class 11 slides are available now, too.)
        3. Project A Proposal instructions and the work you will have done completing the data management there.
        4. Jeffrey Leek, The Elements of Data Analytic Style (the entire text)
        5. David Spiegelhalter The Art of Statistics: How to Learn from Data (introduction and chapters 1-3)
            - I also expect you to have read Chapters 4, 7, 8 and 9 of Spiegelhalter, but I've decided not to ask about them on Quiz 1.
            - Note also that I may not use all of these materials in the Quiz. I don't want it to be too long. 
    - I won't use anything other than those five sources to motivate the questions.
    - You will definitely need to be able to do some coding in R to complete the Quiz. There are also questions that involve interpreting R output, and some questions where R is not relevant at all.
    - The Quiz is meant to take 4 hours, and I have given you 115 hours to do it. Some people will choose to take much, much longer than 4 hours.

## What Should I Be Working On?

1. Minute Paper after Class 11 will be due Wednesday 2020-09-30 at Noon.
2. [Project A](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-projectA/), in particular the Proposal, which is due 2020-10-02.
3. Reading: by 2020-10-02, you'll need to have finished the Leek text and chapters 8-9 of Spiegelhalter.

## One Last Thing

TBA.
