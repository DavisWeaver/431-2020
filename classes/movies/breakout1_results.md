# Results from Movies Breakout Activity (from Class 06: 2020-09-10)

## Exploratory Questions (with planned variables)

Each of the ten breakout groups identified two questions, and specified the variables they would use in addressing them. I present these results below, unedited except to correct a couple of typographical errors. In this table, "ratings" refers to the number of ratings on IMDB (`imdb_ratings`) while "stars" refers to the weighted average star rating (`imdb_stars`) for the film.

## Which is the first movie you've all seen (alphabetically)?

Group(s) | Members | First Movie all had seen
----: | :--: | --------------------------
2, 3, 6, 9 | 6 | 3. Avatar
7 | 5 | 3. Avatar
10 | 4 | 4. Avengers: Endgame
1, 4 | 6 | 11. Black Panther
5 | 6 | 15. The Dark Knight
8 | 6 | 41. Matilda

Based on these ten samples, what do you think is the probability that there is a film on the list of 66 that everyone in the class has seen, including Dr. Love? 

Note: Dr. Love has seen 29 of the 66 films on the list. Of the "stopping places" listed above, he has seen Avengers: Endgame, Black Panther and The Dark Knight, but not Avatar or Matilda.
