## Announcements

1. Reminders about Lab Policies: (visit [Section 12.3 of the Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-syllabus/deliverables-assignments.html#labs) for more details.)
    - All Labs should be turned in by the deadline specified on the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html). We don't actually give extensions on Labs. Instead, we use the following grading policy, also outlined [on the Labs page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/labs/README.md) and in [Section 12.3 of the Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-syllabus/deliverables-assignments.html#labs). 
        - Labs turned in after the deadline but before noon the day after the deadline can receive up to 90% of available points. 
        - Labs turned in after the Answer Sketch is posted, but within one week of the deadline can receive up to 75% of available points.
        - Your lowest two (of eight) Lab grades over the course of the term are dropped before we calculate your Lab grade for the course.
    - The Lab Regrade Request Form is now available at http://bit.ly/431-2020-lab-regrade-requests. If you want Dr. Love to review your grade on a Lab for any reason, fill out the form before 2020-12-10 at Noon. 
        - In mid-December (and not sooner), Dr. Love will open the form. If the additional points you request could change your course grade, he'll review your request. If not, then he won't. 
        - The link to this form is posted [to the Labs page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/labs/README.md#grading-errors-and-regrade-requests) and to the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html).
