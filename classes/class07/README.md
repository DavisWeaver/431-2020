## Today's Slides

- Class 07 slides are available in [PDF format](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/classes/class07/431_class-07-slides_2020.pdf), as well as in [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/classes/class07/431_class-07-slides_2020.Rmd).

## Today's Breakout Activity

- We'll be working on the movies data again.

## Announcements

1. **Lab Policies** (Reminders: visit [Section 12.3 of the Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-syllabus/deliverables-assignments.html#labs) for more details.)
    - All Labs should be in by the deadline on the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html). We don't give extensions on Labs. Instead, we use the following grading policy, also outlined [on the Labs page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/labs/README.md).
        - Labs turned in after the deadline but before noon the next day (when Sketch is posted) can receive up to 90% of available points. 
        - Labs turned in after the Sketch is posted, but within one week of the deadline can receive up to 75% of available points.
        - Your lowest two (of eight) Lab grades this term are dropped before we calculate your Lab grade for the course.
    - The [Lab Regrade Request Form](http://bit.ly/431-2020-lab-regrade-requests) is now available at http://bit.ly/431-2020-lab-regrade-requests. If you want Dr. Love to review your grade on a Lab, [fill out the form](http://bit.ly/431-2020-lab-regrade-requests) before 2020-12-10 at Noon. 
        - Dr. Love will open the form in mid-December after determining course grades. If your requested regrades on Labs could change your course grade, he'll review your regrade request in detail. If not, then he won't. 
        - The form is posted [to the Labs page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/labs/README.md#grading-errors-and-regrade-requests) and to the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html).

2. **Corrections to Course Notes**: Several enterprising students were good enough to let me know about some typographical and other errors in the Course Notes, Chapter 3. A new version was posted on 2020-09-13 that addresses those concerns. If you find a typo, PLEASE let me know through the corrections folder in Piazza, or via direct email.

3. **A Question about Piazza**: We notice that students don't seem to be including their R Markdown files when they ask questions on Piazza. When I create a new question on Piazza, I see a screen that looks like this:

![](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/classes/class07/images/piazza01.png)

and I can click on the ![](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/classes/class07/images/piazza02.png) icon if I want to upload, for example, an R Markdown file. Do you, as students, see the same thing?

4. **Tables in R**: There's a nice blog from Thomas Mock (2020-09-04) on [10+ Guidelines for Better Tables in R](https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-09-04-10-table-rules-in-r/) with links to many other excellent resources. The `gt` package figures substantially into the examples there, and [RStudio's gt page](https://gt.rstudio.com/) is a great place to get inspired to build a truly publication-ready table of information.

5. **Data for Good**: The American Statistical Association has a nice post (2020-09-01) on "[Getting Started in Data for Good](https://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2020/09/01/getting-started-in-data-for-good/)" by David Corliss, describing the growing Data for Good movement and providing some ideas for how people can contribute.

6. **HIP-Cuyahoga**: The [Health Improvement Partnership-Cuyahoga (HIP-Cuyahoga)](https://hipcuyahoga.org/) is a diverse and committed group of people who care about health. HIP-Cuyahoga is building opportunities for everyone in Cuyahoga County to be healthy because we believe everyone should have a fair chance to reach his or her fullest health potential. Their key priorities are eliminating structural racism, healthy eating and active living, chronic disease management and linking clinical and public health. If these are areas of interest for you, I encourage you to join their mailing list, and participate in the programs and other efforts they are making.
    - One closely related such effort is the **[Community Tobacco Survey 2020](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/2020communitytobaccosurvey)**. The Community Awareness and Prevention Association has received continued funding from the Ohio Department of Health to decrease the initiation and use of tobacco by youth and adults, decrease people's exposure to secondhand smoke, and help current tobacco users embrace cessation. If you are interested in helping to develop strategies to improve the overall health and wellness of youth and adults, please feel encouraged to take a brief [Community Tobacco Survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/2020communitytobaccosurvey). 

## What Should I Be Working On? ([calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html) has all deadlines.)

1. There is a Minute Paper after Class 07. Please complete it by noon Wednesday 2020-09-16.
2. Lab 03 is the next deliverable after that. You should be able to complete it by the end of today's class.
3. Readings: By the end of this week, Spiegelhalter through Chapter 4, and Chapter 7, and Leek through section 5, and sections 9-12.
