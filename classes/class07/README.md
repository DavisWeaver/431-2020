## Announcements

1. Lab Policies (Reminders: visit [Section 12.3 of the Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-syllabus/deliverables-assignments.html#labs) for more details.)
    - All Labs should be in by the deadline on the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html). We don't give extensions on Labs. Instead, we use the following grading policy, also outlined [on the Labs page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/labs/README.md).
        - Labs turned in after the deadline but before noon the next day (when Sketch is posted) can receive up to 90% of available points. 
        - Labs turned in after the Sketch is posted, but within one week of the deadline can receive up to 75% of available points.
        - Your lowest two (of eight) Lab grades this term are dropped before we calculate your Lab grade for the course.
    - The [Lab Regrade Request Form](http://bit.ly/431-2020-lab-regrade-requests) is now available at http://bit.ly/431-2020-lab-regrade-requests. If you want Dr. Love to review your grade on a Lab, [fill out the form](http://bit.ly/431-2020-lab-regrade-requests) before 2020-12-10 at Noon. 
        - Dr. Love will open the form in mid-December after determining course grades. If your requested regrades on Labs could change your course grade, he'll review your regrade request in detail. If not, then he won't. 
        - The form is posted [to the Labs page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/labs/README.md#grading-errors-and-regrade-requests) and to the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html).
