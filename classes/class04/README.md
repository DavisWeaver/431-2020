## Today's Slides

- When available, Class 04 slides will be posted in [PDF format](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/classes/class04/431_class-04-slides_2020.pdf), as well as in [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/classes/class04/431_class-04-slides_2020.Rmd).

## Announcements

1. Dr. Love will present some reactions to the Minute Paper after Class 03.
    - Depending on when you completed the Minute Paper, you may have been asked about Leek twice and Spiegelhalter not at all. Sorry about that mistake.
2. The best cheat sheets for working with our tools, in my opinion, are the [R Studio Cheatsheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/).  The ones I use most often are (all are PDF downloads):
    - [Data Visualization](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf) with `ggplot2`, 
    - [Data Transformation](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-transformation.pdf) with `dplyr`, 
    - [R Markdown](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf), and the [R Markdown Reference Guide](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf), 
    - [Factors with forcats](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/factors.pdf), 
    - the [RStudio IDE](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rstudio-ide.pdf), and 
    - [Data Import](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-import.pdf).
3. Don't forget about the other great resources provided by [RStudio Education](https://education.rstudio.com/) including [this Beginner pathway](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/).
    - The [RStudio Primers](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers) are especially helpful for those of you for whom R or the tidyverse are new things, and who like interactive tutorials. 
        - The ones I would recommend most strongly are: [The Basics](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/1), [Work with Data](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/2), [Visualize Data](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/3) and [Tidy Your Data](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/4), all of which would be helpful to review before our first Quiz.
    - I strongly recommend the book [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) which is incredibly helpful in thinking about how to do data science effectively.

## Next Deliverables: What Should I Be Working On?

- Check the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html) for all deadlines.
- The [Course Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-syllabus/) includes a small task that needs to be completed by the end of the day Friday.
- [Lab 01](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/labs/lab01/lab01.md) is due 2020-09-07 (You should now be able to complete all four parts.)
- [Lab 02](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/labs/lab02/lab02.md) is due 2020-09-14 (You should be able to do all 7 parts now.)
- Readings: make sure that you're up to date, including required reading of Leek and also Spiegelhalter (see Lab 02, question 7).
    - In the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-notes/), you should read as you like. We're covering material in class that is also covered in Chapters 1-6.
- Remember that TA office hours are available every day of the week (see [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu) for details and zoom information) and that [Piazza](https://piazza.com/case/fall2020/pqhs431) is always open. We want to help you!
    - Be sure that you've signed up for Piazza through the link I emailed to your preferred and CWRU emails, and connected to the course. (Check your spam folder for the invitation, if necessary.) 
    - As of 2020-09-02 at 11 AM, we still are waiting for seven people.
