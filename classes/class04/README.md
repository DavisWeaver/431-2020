## Today's Slides

- Class 04 slides are available in [PDF format](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/classes/class04/431_class-04-slides_2020.pdf), as well as in [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/classes/class04/431_class-04-slides_2020.Rmd).

## Announcements

1. Dr. Love will present some [reactions to the Minute Paper after Class 03](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/tree/master/minutepapers).
    - Depending on when you completed the Minute Paper, you may have been asked about Leek twice and Spiegelhalter not at all. Sorry about that mistake.
2. The best cheat sheets for working with our tools, in my opinion, are the [R Studio Cheatsheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/).  The ones I use most often are (all are PDF downloads):
    - [Data Visualization](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf) with `ggplot2`, 
    - [Data Transformation](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-transformation.pdf) with `dplyr`, 
    - [R Markdown](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf), and the [R Markdown Reference Guide](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf), 
    - [Factors with forcats](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/factors.pdf), 
    - the [RStudio IDE](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rstudio-ide.pdf), and 
    - [Data Import](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-import.pdf).
3. Don't forget about the other great resources provided by [RStudio Education](https://education.rstudio.com/) including [this Beginner pathway](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/).
    - The [RStudio Primers](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers) are especially helpful for those of you for whom R or the tidyverse are new things, and who like interactive tutorials. 
        - The ones I would recommend most strongly are: [The Basics](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/1), [Work with Data](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/2), [Visualize Data](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/3) and [Tidy Your Data](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/4), all of which would be helpful to review before our first Quiz.
    - I strongly recommend the book [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) which is incredibly helpful in thinking about how to do data science effectively.

## What Should I Be Working On?

- The [Course Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-syllabus/) includes a small task that needs to be completed by the end of the day Friday. 
    - As of `2020-09-02 at 10 PM`, 49 of you have done so, out of 73 enrolled students. I've responded via email to each of you who've done this.
- [Lab 01](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/labs/lab01/lab01.md) is due on Monday 2020-09-07 at 9 PM (Be sure to complete all four parts.)
- [Lab 02](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/labs/lab02/lab02.md) is due 2020-09-14 (You should be able to do all 7 parts now.)
- Readings: check the [Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html) to be sure that you're up to date, including required reading of Leek and also Spiegelhalter (see Lab 02, question 7).
    - In the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-notes/), you should read as you like. We're covering material in class that is also covered in Chapters 1-6.
- TA office hours are available every day of the week (see the Announcements folder in [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu) for schedule and zoom information) and that [Piazza](https://piazza.com/case/fall2020/pqhs431) is always open. We want to help you!
    - When asking a question of a TA or on Piazza, be sure to provide enough information so we can help you. 
        - For an R question, this might include your R Markdown file, and a screenshot of the error you're getting, for example.
    - As of `2020-09-02 at 6:45 PM`, 6 of you (**Akif Gormez**, **Sarah Simmons**, **Enrique Soltero Mariscal**, **Ananya Subramaniam**, **Kiara White** and **Modong Yang**) are not yet signed up for Piazza and connected to the course. This isn't optional and should be done **today**. 
        - Check your spam folder for the invitation, and contact Dr. Love via email (`Thomas dot Love at case dot edu`) if you have questions about signing up for Piazza.
