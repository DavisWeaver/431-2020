- [Lab 01](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/labs/lab01/lab01.md) is due 2020-09-07 (You should now be able to complete all four parts.)

## Announcements

1. Dr. Love will present some reactions to the Minute Paper after Class 03.
  - Depending on when you completed the Minute Paper, you may have been asked about Leek twice and Spiegelhalter not at all. Sorry about that mistake.
2. The best cheat sheets for working with our tools, in my opinion, are the [R Studio Cheatsheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/).  The ones I use most often are (all are PDF downloads):
    - [Data Visualization](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf) with `ggplot2`, 
    - [Data Transformation](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-transformation.pdf) with `dplyr`, 
    - [R Markdown](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf), and the [R Markdown Reference Guide](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf), 
    - [Factors with forcats](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/factors.pdf), 
    - the [RStudio IDE](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rstudio-ide.pdf), and 
    - [Data Import](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-import.pdf).
3. Don't forget about the other great resources provided by [RStudio Education](https://education.rstudio.com/) including [this Beginner pathway](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/) and especially including the book [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) which is incredibly helpful in thinking about how to do data science effectively.
