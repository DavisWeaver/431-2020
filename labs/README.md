## Late Work?

All Labs should be turned in by the deadline specified on the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html). 

- Labs that are turned in after the deadline but before the Answer Sketch for the Lab is posted (usually this will before noon on the next day) can receive up to 90% of available points.
- Labs turned in after the Answer Sketch is posted, but within one week of the deadline can receive up to 75% of available points.
- Your lowest two (of eight) Lab grades over the course of the term will be dropped before we calculate your Lab grade for the course.
