# Lab 02 Materials

Instructions for Lab 02 are in this [.md file](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/labs/lab02/lab02.md)

## After the Lab

- [Answer Sketch](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/tree/master/labs/lab02/sketch) (available in R Markdown and PDF)
- A video recording (nearly 15 minute .mp4) of Dr Love demonstrating the real-time use of R Studio to do (part of) Lab 02 is [now available on our Shared Google Drive](http://bit.ly/431-2020-Love-does-Lab02). This may be especially helpful to those of you having trouble saving your .Rmd and .HTML files or working with R Projects.
